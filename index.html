        <h2>Recharge your smile</h2>
        <p class="longpar"> From whitening to sensitivity, Oral-Bâ€™s unique round brush heads are engineered for every need.The Oral-B electric toothbrush head is a circular shape compared to its competitor Philips Sonicare whose electric 
            toothbrushes are regularly shaped like widened ovals. Oral-B states that their brush head is round because being round it can get into more inaccessible places of your teeth guaranteeing a deep clean of your mouth.
             I also believe that having a circular brush head makes it easier to fit into your mouth and move around. The Phillips Sonicare electric toothbrush has a bigger brush head and would be harder to maneuver around for
              those with smaller mouths. Supporting my previous statement the slim neck of the Oral B electric toothbrush ensures that the brush can reach the further parts of your mouth without the size of the neck being a hindrance.
               The smooth and thick body of the brush gives it style, perspective and most of all is easier to hold. The neck and body of the electric toothbrush are common characteristics shared between both Oral-B and Philips Sonicare.
